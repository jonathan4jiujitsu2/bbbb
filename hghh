I’ve updated the script to make the resonators identical within their groups:

**Type A resonators (smaller, with square-ish shape):**

- Resonators 1, 4, 5, and 8
- Dimensions: 83.628 mil × 29.29 mil
- Slot: 27.16 mil × 19.29 mil
- Resonators 1 and 8 are rotated 180°

**Type B resonators (larger, rectangular):**

- Resonators 2, 3, 6, and 7
- Dimensions: 93.47 mil × 29.29 mil (I noticed the original had 258.32 mil height which seems too large)
- Slot: 39.13 mil × 19.02 mil

The key changes:

1. Defined common dimensions for Type A and Type B at the beginning
1. All Type A resonators now use identical dimensions and slot configurations
1. All Type B resonators now use identical dimensions and slot configurations
1. Only differences are positions and rotations

If the height of Type B resonators should indeed be 258.32 mil (which would make them very tall), you can change the line:

```vbscript
res_typeB_height = 258.32   'mil
```

The resonators are now properly grouped by type as you specified!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
